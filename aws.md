## AWS
 
### Serverless Application

#### Model
> The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS.

#### Repository
> The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications. It enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to store and share reusable applications, and easily assemble and deploy serverless architectures in powerful new ways.

    > AWS CloudFormation provides several built-in functions that help you manage your stacks. Use intrinsic functions in your templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.

### Kinesis 

#### Data Stream
> A Kinesis stream captures and transports data records that are emitted from data sources.

> You can use Kinesis Data Streams for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of data used can include IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real time, the processing is typically lightweight.

#### Data Firehose
> Kinesis Data Firehose can invoke your Lambda function to transform incoming source data and deliver the transformed data to destinations. You can enable Kinesis Data Firehose data transformation when you create your delivery stream.

> It invokes the specified Lambda function asynchronously with each buffered batch using the AWS Lambda synchronous invocation mode. The transformed data is sent from **Lambda** to Kinesis Data Firehose. Kinesis Data Firehose then sends it to the destination when the specified destination buffering size or buffering interval is reached, whichever happens first.

### Glue

> AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. AWS Glue provides all of the capabilities needed for data integration so that you can start analyzing your data and putting it to use in minutes instead of months.

#### Identity Access Management Roles
> An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.
